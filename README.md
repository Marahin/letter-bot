## Development

### Prerequisites

* `docker` and `docker-compose` (unless you want to go bare-metal),
* `make` (unless you want to run commands manually),
* `go` (if you want to develop),

### docker-compose

#### Initial setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values (or leave as-is).
3. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the stack.
4. Run `docker-compose exec bot sh -c "bin/migrate"` to apply migrations.
4. Run `docker-compose exec db bash -c "seed"` to fill any entry-level data.
5. Run `docker-compose restart bot` (as it failed originally, when the database was not set up).

#### After initial setup

1. To start: `docker-compose up -d`
2. Development should hot reload (recompile and restart the bot) on file changes.
2. To stop:`docker-compose stop` or `... down`

#### Shutdown / teardown

1. To shut the service down, `docker-compose stop`
2. (optional) To remove containers and networks, `docker-compose down`
2. (optional) To remove the volumes, such as database, `docker volume rm letter_bot_postgres`

### Database and migrations

If you change SQL schema in any way, remember to:

* regenerate sqlc: `make sqlc-generate` - this generates Go wrapper around our queries,
* run `docker-compose exec bot sh -c "bin/generate_migration <YOUR_MIGRATION_NAME>"` - so if you change a timestamp, you could name it `"users_timestamps"`.

### Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch with your changes
3. Push the branch to your fork
4. Create a pull request
